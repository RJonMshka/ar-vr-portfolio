But since the AR and VR domains are expanding at a fast pace, and we are including these elements in our day-to-day life (in software like Snapchat, Instagram and in AR/VR enabled games). This means that our world has welcomed the concept of mixed reality and the day is not far when people will start experiencing these technologies just like a normal habit like eating or sleeping.

However, this is just an example which scratches only the surfaces of AR enabled technologies. Integrating with advanced technologies like voice recognition, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics will become very easy in the future. So, a simple looking real-world object would be capable of performing tasks like playing videos and audios on the go, browsing the internet, playing games, interacting with virtual space and its objects, and doing pretty much anything that only computers or smartphones are capable of doing now, will eventually become more popular and common. With the ability to controls the behaviour of an AR object, it is highly likely that these objects will live among us and we will be highly dependent upon them. Virtual Objects in real life always look cool and they do impress people by how technology can change world, but people can get real annoyed if models are less interactive, low controllability, generates annoying sounds, glitches in visibility, and are of low detail.

They can simulate keyboard key/mouse click sounds, sense amount of pressure on the keys with features even better than real ones. User will be able to maximize and minimize videos to desired extent with just a slide of a finger. Also, video games these days are getting really advanced, and gamers have started trending custom gaming avatars and custom-made equipment (like guns and knives in Counter Strike: Go). Imagine experiencing these avatars placed on top of our own body. It will be a pivotal point in history for fashion industry. Even our cars can have an AR based skin. We can even use AR tech to replace watches, jewellery, and most of the decorative items in our home and workplaces. Finally, learning is part of our life, and with AR and VR, it can be possible to learn concepts of physics, chemistry, biology, etc visually, with the help of virtual objects.

The whole idea of the project is to create an experience that can help a user to overcome the phobia of working in an office environment. However, it was possible to always test the application on a VR headset due to the headset\u2019s limited availability. So, many times, the application was tested on Spatial Simulator Camera which is like a PC game camera where the user can navigate the virtual space using keyboard (WASD keys) and mouse input. In this essay, we will discuss how experiencing this application on a VR Headset differed from experiencing it in a spatial simulator. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"Due to the limited availability of VR headsets, testing the application on Spatial Simulator has been a great help. It is very easy to switch between different cameras. One of the great advantages of the spatial simulator is that it is very easy to launch. The user just needs to click the play button in Unity (while having the simulator active) and within few seconds it appears in the game section. Also, small interactions with the help of \u201conTriggerEnter\u201d and \u201conCollisionEnter\u201d callbacks can be achieved and tested without the need for a headset. Users can also, test lights, audios, and animation while navigating with the help of the simulator. If the user moves in a different direction, the audio intensity and its directions also seem to change. However, the simulator is like a normal game where the interaction is very limited. It is not possible to grab an interactable item with it. There were a lot of challenges while creating an interactable door to exit from the office and it was one of the major tasks but the spatial simulator was of no use to test this kind of behavior. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"On the other hand, experiencing the application on a VR Headset is far superior and immersive as compared to spatial simulators. As soon as you wear the headset, it feels like your application has come to life. Everything looked bigger and clearer. The audio sound was far more spatial (both in terms of space and changing with head movement as well). Navigating with the help of locomotion was so much easier than WASD movements. But the best part was interacting with the environment, you can grab things, throw them anywhere, walk in the virtual space, lie down, look behind the objects. All these features are unable to be tested on a spatial simulator. Experience your work in VR headsets would make you feel even more proud and it also gives a sense of accomplishment and wonder. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"Although, VR experience is breathtaking, there are some downsides to it as well. People can experience dizziness while interacting with a VR environment. Image falling, from a building or sliding down a steep slant. It can even get scarier if horror elements are utilized. Another disadvantage of the XR Unity camera to Spatial Simulator is that it takes a lot of time to build your application to the VR headset. I have wasted a lot of time, building the application to VR Headset while Spatial Simulator was left active with a mistake. Then I would have to build again which takes around 2-5 minutes. So, testing every segment of the project in the headset was quite challenging. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"Finally, the spatial simulator has a lot of limitations, but beginner-level interactions can be tested on it. It does make the life of a developer pretty easy. However, the complete VR experience can only be achieved through a headset. My recommendation is to use Spatial Simulators to create and placing Audio Sources, lights, materials, game objects with appropriate colliders and physics. However, the scale, spatial sound, interactable objects, and the fine-tuning of the project are meant to be tested with a VR headset."]})]})}var G=a.p+"static/media/avatar1_model.730170a4.PNG",L=a.p+"static/media/avatar2_model.f252effa.PNG",V=a.p+"static/media/bench_model.cb352185.PNG",F=a.p+"static/media/bicycle_model.d85e1a27.PNG",U=a.p+"static/media/bin_model.cdde388a.PNG",E=a.p+"static/media/canopy_model.8440dab3.PNG",B=a.p+"static/media/car_model.5947bbf5.PNG",z=a.p+"static/media/chair_model.283c26c8.PNG",W=a.p+"static/media/coffee-model.9a5abd13.PNG",K=a.p+"static/media/couch_model.df136dd7.PNG",q=a.p+"static/media/custom_lamp_model.1d28179e.PNG",Q=a.p+"static/media/Fence_model.15bcaa04.PNG",J=a.p+"static/media/folder_model.018c189b.PNG",Y=a.p+"static/media/ftc_model.8c54556b.PNG",Z=a.p+"static/media/Grass_model.cda3bbad.PNG",X=a.p+"static/media/keyboard_model.84849b9a.PNG",$=a.p+"static/media/lamp_post_model.ba56c8e0.PNG",ee=a.p+"static/media/lptree_model.97b69eb3.PNG",te=a.p+"static/media/main_image.8ead7b97.PNG",ae=a.p+"static/media/monitor_model.c331d3e2.PNG",ie=a.p+"static/media/pine_tree_model.156aef6c.PNG",se=a.p+"static/media/pool_table_model.0e0ed497.PNG",ne=a.p+"static/media/poolballs_model.453dc84c.PNG",oe=a.p+"static/media/printer_model.d56153a9.PNG",re=a.p+"static/media/railing_model.fe7a5b4c.PNG",le=a.p+"static/media/rock_model.5b6172de.PNG",ce=a.p+"static/media/stairs-model.db4f74a9.PNG",he=a.p+"static/media/stc_model.0089e125.PNG",de=a.p+"static/media/street_cone_model.938054d9.PNG",me=a.p+"static/media/traffic_sign_model.b97fd64d.PNG",pe=a.p+"static/media/trash_can_model.abcc3794.PNG",ge=a.p+"static/media/tv_model.1c8ba230.PNG",ue=a.p+"static/media/poolLamp_model.e28323a0.PNG",be=a.p+"static/media/poolstick_model.a7e4f99e.PNG",fe=a.p+"static/media/ps5_model.a375b254.PNG",je=a.p+"static/media/ps5ctrl_model.e114cd55.PNG",xe=a.p+"static/media/ttball_generator_model.9806ee5c.PNG",we=a.p+"static/media/ttball_model.ed5014f1.PNG",ye=a.p+"static/media/ttbat_model.da06c1e8.PNG",ke=a.p+"static/media/ttnet_model.8cdcbdd9.PNG",ve=a.p+"static/media/tttable_model.69f92758.PNG",Oe=a.p+"static/media/tvholder_model.d0abd1d2.PNG",Te=a.p+"static/media/vending_machine.40ca2057.PNG",Ie={introduction:{text:"Project 2 for CS-428 that I have been working on is based on helping people with a phobia of working in an Office or returning to the office. Some other names of this kind of phobia are Ergophobia or \u2018work aversion\u2019. Both the terms are derived from Greek ergon meaning work and 'phobos' which comes from the Greek God of Fear. The individuals suffering from it are afraid to seek employment from fear of being yelled at by superiors, or, in general, due to performance or social anxiety. Ergophobia is thus a complex phobia as it may be part of many different phobias or mental issues. Some of the causes of fear of going to work are Schizophrenia, Fear of rejection, disorderly sleep, medical drugs, traumatic incidents, clinical depression or neurological dysfunctions, and many more. Also, after the COVID-19 pandemic, people all across the world have been working from home. Some of them are finding remote working better than working in an office environment. However, the effect of COVID-19 is decreasing day by day (thanks to our vaccine researchers) and a lot of organizations are trying to open up their office space and shifting to the work environment which was normal 2 years ago. Due to this sudden shift, people who like working from home will eventually find discomfort in scheduling their work and daily activities. It can not only affect their work productivity but also can lead to work-related stress, social anxiety, and other office-related phobias. <br/><br/> With the help of Unity, VRTK v4, and virtual reality headsets, this application tries to overcome the phobia of working in (or returning to) an office environment. The Project is a VR application and is best experienced when it is launched on a VR headset like Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2. The individual using this application will go through various experiences like Performing a job, getting scolded by office colleagues, roaming around the office environment, going to a meeting, playing recreational games, and walking outside as well. By adding such features, the individual can face his/her fear of offices by confronting office colleagues, as well as get a feeling of accomplishment by doing some easy tasks and finally, have some fun playing games. All these features are added so that the level of phobia for that individual gets reduced.",heading:"INTRODUCTION",imageCaption:"Project 2 Main Image",imageAlt:"intro image"},setup:["This project will work on either Windows or Mac OS.

Then there is a Television (big one) in the main hall requesting the user to perform few tasks, like printing pages and moving folders to a different place. Once those tasks are complete, the user gets assertive audio feedback from the avatar standing next to the television screen. Also, the tasks on television get updated. There is a person avatar on the first floor sitting in one of the cubical which yells at the user when approached. The user can print a page and new pages are automatically generated and the user can interact with them as well. The folders are also interactable. To move to the second floor, accessibility of stairs is provided. On the 2nd floor, there is a cafeteria where the user can see two avatars sitting and experience the ambient sound of a typical cafeteria. Roaming around those avatars can help the user to overcome social anxiety and social insecurities. Also, there is a coffee room where is coffee machine is located, there is also an ambient sound related to coffee. Also, there are various lighting schemes near the recreational area where you can play 3 types of games (Table Tennis, 8-Ball Pool, and Video game). By playing a game, I mean that the user can interact with some parts of the game. For instance, a user can interact with a pool stick and hit pool balls. There are appropriate physics, motion, and sounds attached to all of them. Similarly, in the table tennis environment, a user can interact with table tennis bats, ping bong balls. Since the ping pong ball is so easy to lose, there is a ping pong ball generator that generates ping pong ball into a box and the user can interact with any number of newly generated balls. Now the video game setup looks like a PlayStation 5 with controllers along with a couch, tables, and a television. The controllers are also interactable and if the user picks up one of the controllers, the PS5 logo appears on the television screen with ps5 launch audio. The user can roam around other parts of the 2nd Floor also like the meeting room. The meeting room has an ambient sound of which feels like someone is writing something on the whiteboard. As soon as the user approaches the meeting room, a person avatar asks and stops the user saying that the user is late for the meeting. Now, there is an interactable door on the 2nd floor that can be opened with grab action with VR controllers, and then the user will be able to access the outer world.",heading:"Inside the Office Space",imageAlt:"Inside View",imageCaption:"Project 2 Office View",assets:{fromInternet:[{text:"<span class='model-name'>Printer Model by \u201cc-brenner\u201d:</span> This model has the ability to spawn multiple pages on touch of a button present on it (pages are interactable).

has given more gravity and quality to the idea of project 2 and extended it in such a way that makes people wonder what can be achieved through Virtual Reality(VR). The Mego Playset version presents how components of a complicated and comprehensive environment can be updated, rearranged, and even improved by scaling the situation to a diminutive one, and in this way, the user can handle all of the conditions within the palms of his/her hands. The Land of Giants perspective reveals us a perspective where the user can interact with objects that are quite trivial to interact within a normal perspective. Dancing on the Ceiling perspective demonstrates how the user\u2019s viewpoint and movements can be affected by just revolving around the whole environment. Finally, the Zero-Gravity perspective provides the user a simple and significant way to navigate in an environment where walking is just not feasible. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"In the applications of planning, structuring, and architecting, the architects and engineers generally have a model or miniature version of their desired product. This model is to check and show other people the work they have accomplished or to display what the genuine outcome would resemble. But in the real world, the physical models are not pragmatic and lack a lot of information. For example, designing a restaurant would need an architect to develop a physical model of a restaurant but still the architect cannot demonstrate lightings, audio, how people would sit in the restaurant, the ambiance, and many more external factors. The Mego Playset version of Project 2 gives a brief demonstration of what that architect can achieve by just replacing real models with virtual ones and creating a virtual environment instead of an artificial model. Physics Engines like Unity and Unreal Engine are very apt in replicating the real-world environment in terms of visuals, audios, animations, and interactions. The idea of presenting a virtual world to the supervisors and letting others experience the virtual world of your sought product will make the whole thing more appealing. It is capable of providing an immersive experience rather than just having a demonstration. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"The Land of the Giants perspective will be extremely helpful in scenarios associated with the exploration of a virtual world. Let us take the example of planet Mars. Scientists around the globe are trying to find whether life can be sustained on Mars or not. Unfortunately, this question has not been answered but with the help of VR, advancements can be made in exploring the surface of Mars. With a perspective like Land of the Giants, users can visualize and study minute objects on the surface of Mars. One of the other applications can be exploring insects and micro-organisms. People have been studying microorganisms and insects with the help of microscopes and ultra-zoom cameras. However, a detailed VR perspective can help gain more insights into their behaviors. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"Virtual Reality is so immersive that it makes our brain believe that the virtual environment is real and we experience anomalies in the virtual world as they are happening in real. This level of immersion can help educate and aware souls of real-life calamities. The Dancing on the Ceiling tries to simulate a world where the environment rotates and the whole experience is very surreal and terrifying at the same time. The situations like earthquakes, breakdown of a building, etc can be simulated with similar experiences. In the majority of the places where human life is abundant, there is also a risk of earthquakes. This kind of simulation can help people learn about how to behave in such circumstances. People can learn that if a similar situation ever arrives in the real world, they would know how to act. This is a nice way of teaching survival in any natural or man-made catastrophe. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"Finally, zero-gravity in VR is one of the ways to help astronauts experience zero-gravity. The ability of Unity to add forces that are governed by real-world physics accurately replicates the zero-gravity situation even in a virtual simulation. Zero-gravity is also a fun experience that people find amusing. This perspective can even be helpful in gaming as well. ",Object(h.jsx)("br",{}),"All of these experiences are bound with the help of an interactive menu. A presence of a menu or a control system can help the user control the navigation of the whole experience.

It includes how a VR user experiences the virtual environment when the navigation, visuals, audios, and perspectives change and the way that the user interacts under those perspectives. The project consists of multiple scenes starting with the classic Project 2 scene with the addition of a spatial menu, from where the user can navigate to other scenes. The first different scene that was built as part of Project 3 is \u201cThe Mego Playset\u201d version of Project 2. It represents the whole Project 2 room as a dollhouse sitting on a table with some action figures and a lamp in another room. Users can change the position/location of items in the whole office area and can also place the action figures which are outside the room, into the room. The next version is \u201cThe Land of the Giants\u201d version where the user\u2019s perspective changes and becomes equivalent to a person with a height of about 1 foot. Here, the user lands on a typical office table where the user can interact with different items on the table in a different way, experience audios differently and can also climb up and down from this and other tables nearly. The third version is \u201cDancing on the Ceiling\u201d where the scaling is normal, but the user gets control of rotating the whole world with the factor of 90-degree change on a particular axis and the user would experience the things around him/her falling as a result of the change in room\u2019s orientation. The last version is \u201cZero Gravity\u201d where the user\u2019s virtual body becomes unaffected by gravity so that the user levitates in the air and moves around the room with the help of some external force(s). Also, all the interactable objects in the room are unaffected by gravity.",heading:"INTRODUCTION",imageCaption:"Project 3 Main Image",imageAlt:"intro image",imageSrc:$e},setup:["This project will work on either Windows or Mac OS.

A click is the preferred input as compared to hold for the proper working of the menu\u2019s display.  If navigating through a spatial simulator camera, the menu can be activated/deactivated with a right click of the mouse.<br />\n        Another feature of the menu is that, in every scene, one button on the menu is disabled and that button belongs to switching scene to the current scene which user is currently experiencing. For example, if the user is navigating in the Mego Playset scene, then the Mego Playset button will be disabled. There are different active, inactive, hover, disabled visual states. It means that the user will be able to distinguish between them very clearly. The user needs to use Tilia\u2019s Spatial straight pointer (which can be activated with the right controller\u2019s joystick) for interacting with buttons on the menu. If the right controller\u2019s joystick button is pressed which spatial pointer is pointing at an active menu button item, the scene will be switched accordingly.<br />\n        The spatial buttons on the menu have colliders associated with them, so the size and location of the menu are chosen accordingly.

Holonautics) which is completely focused on hand interactions. The game utilizes Oculus Quest/Quest 2\u2019s native Hand tracking capabilities and it makes strong use of believable physics. Oculus Quest/Quest 2 uses Computer Vision to detect hand and finger movements in real-time. Hand Physics Lab utilizes this feature\u2019s full potential. The idea of this game is very original and unique and it provides a glimpse of how hand-tracking games will be like in the future. <br/>",text2:"The gameplay of Hand Physics Lab consists of more than 80 levels and each one of those is centered on solving simple puzzles which involve basic physics. There is a lot of variations in these levels, but some of the tasks involved are: Pressing Button, Moving Objects, painting, stacking objects, throwing objects, etc. Most of the tasks are independent of others and the time to complete a single task is very short. It generally takes a minute or less to solve a task if the user knows what to do.<br/>",text3:"Performing these tasks is done through skeleton hands which are the real-time virtual representation of the user\u2019s real hands. With the help of the skeleton hands, actions need to be performed respecting the laws of Physics. This means that hands cannot move through static objects like tables, some objects have a good amount of weight associated with them, so the game makes it difficult for the user to lift heavy objects, the physics involved with objects is so good that sometimes things fall when are not properly stacked. These kinds of things make the game fun as well as challenging. As the levels go by, this game tries to throw away anything that helps the user to complete the task comfortably.<br/>",text4:"Since this game does not explain what the user would have to do to complete the task, the user has to learn through experience and experimentations in the game. Probably that is why the initial levels are basic, which intrinsically introduce the interactions of virtual hands and it gradually keeps on adding additional challenges and subtle difficulties to keep it more interesting and challenging. For every level you play, you are awarded 1 to 3 stars depending on the time it took for the user to complete. The number of stars achieved doesn\u2019t restrict the user from accessing the next level, it is just for personal satisfaction. Any task can be played with the user\u2019s hands, oculus quest controllers, or in a third person, where tasks are needed to be completed with a small version of the user\u2019s hands.<br/>",text5:"Completing more levels of puzzles unlocks more items in the Sandbox. Sandbox is a different feature than puzzles. In the Sandbox, users can have the ability to experiment and play around with tools that are part of the puzzle levels (like Pistols, eggs, lasers, painting, drawing, generating force field, telekinesis, etc.).",introImage:{imageSrc:"https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/49515/handphysicslab_2560_1440jpg.jpg",imageAlt:"intro Image",caption:"Hand Physics Lab"},uiVideo:{videoSrc:"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SparseSmoothHydatidtapeworm-mobile.mp4",caption:"User Interface and Interactions"},iTaskVideo:{videoSrc:"https://giant.gfycat.com/EvenGoodnaturedFlyingsquirrel.mp4",caption:"Complex but Intelligent"}},subParts:{p1:"This game can be played with controllers or bare hands. However, using controllers make tasks too easy and destroys the whole idea of the game. It is recommended to use bare hands to control and interact with virtual objects which makes it more fun.<br/>\n        Control with hands tracking is designed in such a way that doing anything in the whole game feels very much natural. The position of virtual hands and the user\u2019s real hand might not be the same but the human brain quickly adapts to glitchy hands during gameplay.<br/>\n        Users have to be very subtle and precise with hand movements and finger poses sometimes to move, grab virtual objects.<br/>\n        There is a very rich physics associated with every object and how hands interact with these objects. This is one of the best features of this game. The ability to deploy objects that have very accurate colliders and rigid bodies associated with them makes this game even more interesting and engaging.\n        ",p2:"Since it is meant to play with bare hands, there is nothing like haptic feedback like the controllers provide, so, this game has to provide a graphical element to give visual/sound clues to the user. Buttons are reactive to touch just like a mouse hover in a computer and also to pressure just like a mouse click.<br/>\n        The hand changes color subtly which makes the user understand if they are not working as intended. If they are turning red, it means Oculus is not able to track them properly. If hands are turning yellow, it means that they are getting tracked well but they are not where they should be in the virtual world (like they are stuck beneath some virtual surface).<br/>\n        Some menus and dashboards give you cues for interacting with the game. There is also an introductory tutorial for helping the user with calibration of the game which provides the idea of the overall setting that the user can change in this game.\n        ",p3:"The game has a comic-like graphic style, the whole setup looks pretty much black and white. Vibrant colors are provided to the object that needs to be interacted with which makes them more focusable. There are a good amount of details to the object that the user interacts with.",p4:"There is always some music that is getting played in the background which makes it more interesting than a game with no audio. There are decent sounds when objects collide with each other or when the user places an object at the desired place. There is a realistic feel to these sounds. For Example, when a button is pressed it makes a satisfying sound of an exact button press. Also, there is one puzzle where the user draws on a drawable surface and the sound of a pen screeching the surface also seems pretty realistic.",p5:"Some of the users have experience a weird thing after continuously playing this game for some time, people feel that their hands are meat puppets and they felt heavy and useless. This happens because this game can affect proprioception up to certain extent. It means that while playing the game, the brain can make users into thinking that the rubber hands are their real hands.",controlImage:{imageSrc:a.p+"static/media/hpl_control.b90486b1.jpg",imageAlt:"Control",caption:"Controlling and Interacting with Objects in Hand Physics Lab"},uiImage:{imageSrc:a.p+"static/media/hpl_ui.2d15835b.jpg",imageAlt:"UI",caption:"Typical View in Hand Physics Lab"}},howGood:{text1:"The whole idea of Virtual Reality is to provide a mind-blowing experience by introducing users to an immersive virtual space where all the objects are completely different from the real world, however, the audio and interactions with these objects make it possible for the user to think and believe that the virtual space feels significantly authentic.\n        With the help of an object that looks and holds genuine, this game tries the user to immerse in a virtual environment that feels very close to actuality. The ability of this game to keep users engaging even with glitchy hand tracking is extraordinary.<br/>",text2:"Also, looking at the amount of intelligence involved in performing tasks and the ability to provide users with different tools and ways to accomplish this task make it even more immersive. For example, one of the tasks involves chopping off the user\u2019s hands and placing them in a bowl. When the hands are all chopped off, they can crawl their way back into the bowl. Also, the user can use their arms (without hands) and other objects of the environment such as moving the bowl near chopped hands. So, there are lots of elements involved just like the real world which makes this game even more interesting and it adds to one of the successes of Virtual Reality.<br/>",text3:"Additionally, the ability of the game to use hand tracking for functioning makes us think that even a low fidelity camera can produce the right amount of hands-tracking capabilities and can even be further enhanced with advancements in the software. It makes us think that with the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, even more, immersive tracking capabilities can be achieved in future software/hardware setup at lower prices. This means that the general audience can be able to afford this application.<br/>"},intendedUsers:{text1:"The best way to describe this game is that it is \u201cFun and Frustrating\u201d at the same time. So, this game is probably for people who want to explore Virtual Reality for amusement and also want to spend some time brainstorming and solving puzzles with practical controls. Also, the game is intended for users who want to experience something new as compared to regular VR games as it majorly functions on hand tracking rather than the controllers. Playing this game with controllers would seem easy and boring. However, when we use hands, the difficulty and challenge involved to perform tasks make a lasting impression on the user and the users will be more inclined towards playing this game frequently. Most of the users have experienced something completely new in this game. For example, ideas like using Force Field and Telekinesis to move an object are simply mind-blowing.<br/>",text2:"Additionally, the puzzles involved in this game don\u2019t take much time to solve which makes this game perfect for people who want to play games that involve small challenges and are not that time-consuming.<br/>",text3:"Also, this game can be played with Oculus Quest/Quest 2 headsets which are one of the best-value Virtual Reality headsets available these days. To buy this game, users have to pay 9.99 dollars in the Oculus store (<a href='https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3392175350802835/'  target='_blank'>link</a>) which is relatively cheap considering the experience it provides.

Once, they are solved, users won\u2019t feel a need to complete them again.","The virtual space involved is pretty small. So, users cannot navigate much in this and have only one place to interact in.","There is no support of a multiplayer environment which would have made it even more fun and also would have involved some collaboration.","As per some reviews, this game can cause 'proprioceptive drift' which can affect the ability of mind to coordinate the hands in real world."],sources:["https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3392175350802835/","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaAC0BeAu6A","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-w7omxJuOk","https://vrscout.com/news/hand-physics-lab-oculus-quest/","https://www.roadtovr.com/hand-physics-lab-review/","https://skarredghost.com/2021/04/15/hand-physics-lab-review-2/","https://uploadvr.com/hand-physics-lab-review/","https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SparseSmoothHydatidtapeworm-mobile.mp4","https://giant.gfycat.com/EvenGoodnaturedFlyingsquirrel.mp4"]};function lt(e){return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"video-holder",children:[Object(h.jsx)("video",{controls:!0,children:Object(h.jsx)("source",{src:e.videoSrc})}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:e.caption})]})}function ct(){return Object(h.jsx)(h.Fragment,{children:Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"container sc-container",children:[Object(h.jsx)("h1",{className:"sc-heading",children:"HAND PHYSICS LAB"}),Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"sc-intro sc-item",id:"scIntro",children:[Object(h.jsx)(y,{itemHeading:"INTRODUCTION",itemText:rt.introduction.text1,isItemTextComponent:!1,isItemText:!0,isImage:!1}),Object(h.jsx)(y,{itemHeading:"",itemText:rt.introduction.text2,isItemTextComponent:!1,isItemText:!0,isImage:!1}),Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"sc-item sc-item-small",children:Object(h.jsx)(w,Object(ot.a)({},rt.introduction.introImage))}),Object(h.jsx)(y,{itemHeading:"",itemText:rt.introduction.text3,isItemTextComponent:!1,isItemText:!0,isImage:!1}),Object(h.jsx)(y,{itemHeading:"",itemText:rt.introduction.text4,isItemTextComponent:!1,isItemText:!0,isImage:!1}),Object(h.jsx)(y,{itemHeading:"",itemText:rt.introduction.text5,isItemTextComponent:!1,isItemText:!0,isImage:!1})]}),Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"sc-item sc-video",children:Object(h.jsx)("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-w7omxJuOk",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer;
