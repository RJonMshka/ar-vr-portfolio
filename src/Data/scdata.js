        "text1": `Hand Physics Lab is a Virtual Reality(VR) experience developed by Dennys Kuhnert (Co-founder of Holonautics) which is completely focused on hand interactions. The game utilizes Oculus Quest/Quest 2’s native Hand tracking capabilities and it makes strong use of believable physics. Oculus Quest/Quest 2 uses Computer Vision to detect hand and finger movements in real-time. Hand Physics Lab utilizes this feature’s full potential. The idea of this game is very original and unique and it provides a glimpse of how hand-tracking games will be like in the future. <br/>`,
        "text2": `The gameplay of Hand Physics Lab consists of more than 80 levels and each one of those is centered on solving simple puzzles which involve basic physics. There is a lot of variations in these levels, but some of the tasks involved are: Pressing Button, Moving Objects, painting, stacking objects, throwing objects, etc. Most of the tasks are independent of others and the time to complete a single task is very short. It generally takes a minute or less to solve a task if the user knows what to do.<br/>`,
        "text3": `Performing these tasks is done through skeleton hands which are the real-time virtual representation of the user’s real hands. With the help of the skeleton hands, actions need to be performed respecting the laws of Physics. This means that hands cannot move through static objects like tables, some objects have a good amount of weight associated with them, so the game makes it difficult for the user to lift heavy objects, the physics involved with objects is so good that sometimes things fall when are not properly stacked. These kinds of things make the game fun as well as challenging. As the levels go by, this game tries to throw away anything that helps the user to complete the task comfortably.<br/>`,
        "text4": `Since this game does not explain what the user would have to do to complete the task, the user has to learn through experience and experimentations in the game. Probably that is why the initial levels are basic, which intrinsically introduce the interactions of virtual hands and it gradually keeps on adding additional challenges and subtle difficulties to keep it more interesting and challenging. For every level you play, you are awarded 1 to 3 stars depending on the time it took for the user to complete. The number of stars achieved doesn’t restrict the user from accessing the next level, it is just for personal satisfaction. Any task can be played with the user’s hands, oculus quest controllers, or in a third person, where tasks are needed to be completed with a small version of the user’s hands.<br/>`,
        "text5": `Completing more levels of puzzles unlocks more items in the Sandbox. Sandbox is a different feature than puzzles. In the Sandbox, users can have the ability to experiment and play around with tools that are part of the puzzle levels (like Pistols, eggs, lasers, painting, drawing, generating force field, telekinesis, etc.).`,

        "p1": `This game can be played with controllers or bare hands. However, using controllers make tasks too easy and destroys the whole idea of the game. It is recommended to use bare hands to control and interact with virtual objects which makes it more fun.<br/>
        Control with hands tracking is designed in such a way that doing anything in the whole game feels very much natural. The position of virtual hands and the user’s real hand might not be the same but the human brain quickly adapts to glitchy hands during gameplay.<br/>
        Users have to be very subtle and precise with hand movements and finger poses sometimes to move, grab virtual objects.<br/>
        There is a very rich physics associated with every object and how hands interact with these objects. This is one of the best features of this game. The ability to deploy objects that have very accurate colliders and rigid bodies associated with them makes this game even more interesting and engaging.
        `,
        "p2": `Since it is meant to play with bare hands, there is nothing like haptic feedback like the controllers provide, so, this game has to provide a graphical element to give visual/sound clues to the user. Buttons are reactive to touch just like a mouse hover in a computer and also to pressure just like a mouse click.<br/>
        The hand changes color subtly which makes the user understand if they are not working as intended. If they are turning red, it means Oculus is not able to track them properly. If hands are turning yellow, it means that they are getting tracked well but they are not where they should be in the virtual world (like they are stuck beneath some virtual surface).<br/>
        Some menus and dashboards give you cues for interacting with the game. There is also an introductory tutorial for helping the user with calibration of the game which provides the idea of the overall setting that the user can change in this game.
        `,
        "p3": `The game has a comic-like graphic style, the whole setup looks pretty much black and white. Vibrant colors are provided to the object that needs to be interacted with which makes them more focusable. There are a good amount of details to the object that the user interacts with.`,
        "p4": `There is always some music that is getting played in the background which makes it more interesting than a game with no audio. There are decent sounds when objects collide with each other or when the user places an object at the desired place. There is a realistic feel to these sounds. For Example, when a button is pressed it makes a satisfying sound of an exact button press. Also, there is one puzzle where the user draws on a drawable surface and the sound of a pen screeching the surface also seems pretty realistic.`,

        "text1": `The whole idea of Virtual Reality is to provide a mind-blowing experience by introducing users to an immersive virtual space where all the objects are completely different from the real world, however, the audio and interactions with these objects make it possible for the user to think and believe that the virtual space feels significantly authentic.
        With the help of an object that looks and holds genuine, this game tries the user to immerse in a virtual environment that feels very close to actuality. The ability of this game to keep users engaging even with glitchy hand tracking is extraordinary.<br/>`,
        "text2": `Also, looking at the amount of intelligence involved in performing tasks and the ability to provide users with different tools and ways to accomplish this task make it even more immersive. For example, one of the tasks involves chopping off the user’s hands and placing them in a bowl. When the hands are all chopped off, they can crawl their way back into the bowl. Also, the user can use their arms (without hands) and other objects of the environment such as moving the bowl near chopped hands. So, there are lots of elements involved just like the real world which makes this game even more interesting and it adds to one of the successes of Virtual Reality.<br/>`,
        "text3": `Additionally, the ability of the game to use hand tracking for functioning makes us think that even a low fidelity camera can produce the right amount of hands-tracking capabilities and can even be further enhanced with advancements in the software (Holonautic released an update of this application, in which hand tracking is much more improved). It makes us think that with the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, even more, immersive tracking capabilities can be achieved in future software/hardware setup at lower prices. This means that the general audience can be able to access the wonders and out-of-the-world experiences with Virtual Reality.<br/>`

    "intendedUsers": {
        "text1": `The best way to describe this game is that it is “Fun and Frustrating” at the same time. So, this game is probably for people who want to explore Virtual Reality for amusement and also want to spend some time and brainstorming on solving puzzles with practical controls. Also, the game is intended for users who want to experience something new as compared to regular VR games as it majorly functions on hand tracking rather than the controllers. Playing this game with controllers would seem easy and boring. However, when we use hands, the difficulty and challenge involved to perform tasks make a lasting impression on the user and the users will be more inclined towards playing this game frequently. Most of the users have experienced something completely new in this game. For example, ideas like using Force Field and Telekinesis to move an object are simply mind-blowing.<br/>`,
        "text2": `Additionally, the puzzles involved in this game don’t take much time to solve which makes this game perfect for people who want to play games that involve small challenges and are not that time-consuming.<br/>`,
        "text3": `Also, this game can be played with Oculus Quest/Quest 2 headsets which are one of the best-value Virtual Reality headsets available these days. To buy this game, users have to pay 9.99 dollars in the Oculus store (<a href='https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3392175350802835/'  target='_blank'>link</a>) which is relatively cheap considering the experience it provides. Overall, an average individual interested in Virtual Reality can access this game and it won’t disappoint the user in any way.<br/>`,

    "pros": [
        "Interacting with hands instead of controllers can be more immersive and gives more control to the user.",
        "The idea of acting very carefully and under some form of uncertainty makes the puzzles more challenging and fun.",
        "The physics involved with the virtual objects is very realistic and hence, the whole experience feels very real.",
        "Very genius interactions are involved which tests the user’s intelligence.",
        "Realistic sounds and detailed objects build up a rich experience.",
        "Variety in puzzles keeps it interesting over time.",
        "It generally takes a short amount of time to solve a single puzzle, hence, it is not that time-consuming.",
        "There are multiple ways to solve a problem, user can utilize other elements of the surroundings to reach the goal.",
        "This game has a feature to change perspective. So, users can have fun trying to solve puzzles from a different viewpoint."

    "cons": [
        "Interacting with hands disables the user to get any kind of haptic feedback. Users in the virtual world would be touching and grabbing objects, but users won’t get any sense of grabbing anything in the real world.",
        "The hand tracking that this game uses is completely based on Oculus Quest/Quest 2’s native hand-tracking capabilities which can be glitchy in some moments. Also, Quest/Quest 2’s cameras are low-fidelity, which restricts users to replicated their intentions. If the user is not playing this game in the right amount of light, he/she may have a bad impression of this game.",
        "In some cases, when hand tracking stops working, virtual hands can make an unwanted move and may destroy any progress that the user has made during the tasks.",
        "The headset should always be facing the hand to correctly track them, interacting with an object while looking somewhere else is not that great.",
        "Sometimes users can completely lose the ability to track hands which can be off-putting.",
        "Since this game does not help the user to solve the puzzle. The complexity can be challenging and frustrating to solve.",
        "There are only around 85 puzzles. Once, they are solved, users won’t feel a need to complete them again.",
        "The virtual space involved is pretty small. So, users cannot navigate much in this and have only one place to interact in.",
        "There is no support of a multiplayer environment which would have made it even more fun and also would have involved some collaboration."
